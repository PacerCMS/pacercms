== Install ==
We have put together a fairly comprehensive set of installation instructions on the link below. See the "PacerCMS Developers" section for a link to our forum for additional assistance.

== Subversion ==
If you have shell access to your Web server and the means to do so, we strongly recommend using subversion to keep up with changes to the code base. While regular releases are the goal, updates can be published much faster through the version controlled system.

From the shell:    # Non-members may check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.    svn checkout http://pacercms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pacercms
