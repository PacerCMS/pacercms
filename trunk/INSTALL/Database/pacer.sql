Coleman said.\r\n\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Then, if something comes up missing, report it immediately.Ã¢â‚¬?\r\nHe added that students should never give such information over the telephone, either, unless the student initiated the call or is familiar with the person requesting the information.\r\n\r\nColeman also suggested that students be cautious in sending personal information over the Internet, especially with online purchasing on the rise, and should tear up or shred credit card receipts and bank receipts.\r\n\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave receipts in the ATM or drop them in the trash, because someone will take them and use them for identity theft,Ã¢â‚¬? Coleman said.\r\n\r\nOther safety tips from OPS include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Keep all doors and windows locked during any absence, whether you live in a dorm, apartment or house.</li>\r\n<li> Do not let strangers know you are alone.</li>\r\n<li> Travel in numbers, especially when you are in an isolated area for some time.</li>\r\n<li> Hold your purse or briefcase securely, close to your body. Keep backpacks zipped and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave them lying around anywhere.</li>\r\n<li> Never hitchhike or pick up hitchhikers.</li>\r\n<li> Keep curtains closed at night to prevent a prowler from gaining a view of you or learning you are not there.</li>\r\n<li> Check identification of unknown visitors before allowing them entrance.</li>  \r\n<li> Give only the necessary key(s) to a mechanic or parking attendant.</li>\r\n<li> Do not tag keys with your name and address.

Hi, my name is Matt Crouch and I am the executive editor of The Pacer. This will be the second semester that I have held the position, third semester on Pacer staff. This is my fourth year at UTM and I will be graduating in May.\r\n\r\nI am a Communications major with a minor in Political Science.\r\nThere, that pretty much wraps things up with me. I am a busy person on campus, so hopefully I will be seeing you guys around and getting to know you all.\r\n\r\nThis year is not only a special one for me because I am graduating but also because my little brother is starting his first year at UTM this semester. \r\n\r\nJacob, I am very proud of you for making the decision to come here and I cannot wait for this year to get started. I think we will have a great time together.\r\n\r\nI have not yet made it to Martin as I worked this summer at a camp in Virginia, so at the moment, I am on a mountainside with screaming kids in the distance. I will make it back in time for classes though.\r\n\r\n1. Remember that this is college. For most of you, your parents are not here so this is an adjustment. For the love of God, do not go home every weekend. \r\n\r\nI would hate to have to personally set up barriers on the roads leaving Martin on Fridays just to keep you all here. There is a world of learning and opportunity to be found here, most not within the academic walls but in the socializing with others and trying new things. \r\n\r\nThe most important things you will learn here will not be in a classroom. Some of you will spend this time in college, some will spend it in school Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the difference comes in where you spend your time outside of class, at home with the parents or out trying something new.\r\n\r\n2. GET INVOLVED. If there is one thing UTM is not short of, it is unused opportunities.\r\n\r\nThere are several campus organizations of all types and there is no reason that you should not join at least one. It does not matter if it is Greek, academic, or departmental, you should all join and be involved with something. \r\n\r\nRemember that Freshman Council applications and interviews are coming up soon, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss out on that. \r\n\r\nCollege, like many things, is something that you get out of what you put in. If you only put in a little, you will only get back a little. \r\n\r\nIf you give a lot, it is very rewarding. \r\n\r\nP.S. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Write for The Pacer.\r\n\r\n3. Go into this with an open mind. Get out there and meet new people, experience new things,  and try something you have never done before. \r\n\r\nYou will get nothing from your time here if you spend all of your time in your dorm room playing video games. Get out, go across the hall and knock on the door of one of your new neighbors. These are people that you are going to be living next to for the next nine months so find out who they are. \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of new things to be found here, if you close your mind to them then you are doing yourself an injustice.\r\n\r\n4. Lastly, I will pass on some advice given to me during my first year from a professor here at UTM who has since retired. \r\n\r\nThe key to college is finding the balance between the partying and the books. If you party too much you will flunk out and will be living in your parents basement working at the local convenience store. This will lead to thinking that the girl/guy who has most of their teeth is one of the finest around. \r\n\r\nIf you study too much your brain will explode and will be useless. Find the balance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a little of both is necessary. \r\n\r\nAlso, remember that when it comes to GPA the easy classes count just as much as the hard ones, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t slack off on a class just because it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hard.\r\n\r\nThat is about all that I can think of, but do not worry, if I think of more I will let you know. Most of all though,  have fun! \r\n\r\nCollege is loads of fun, take every chance you get to enjoy it.  It does not matter if it is a 3 a.m. trip to the gas station to get food, a spontaneous road trip or just time hanging out with a good friend in their dorm room Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI hope that you all have enjoyed Freshman Studies and are looking forward to your first year at UTM. I will see you all soon.\r\n\r\n', 1, 'Columns', '2002-08-16 00:00:00', '2005-12-10 00:00:00', 821);

Pep groups formed earlier this week coined a slogan which they proudly chanted during their march to the bleachers.  Some groups were more creative than others.  Group 14 adorned their body with blue and orange paint.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“We decided to put our group number on our arms.  All the guys wrote on themselves that they love Patti, their female pep leader, and the girls wrote that they love their male pep leader, Andrew,Ã¢â‚¬? says Lance Morgan, a member of Group 14.  Other groups added UTM color and sound to the crowd with flags, posters, confetti and air horns.  \r\n\r\nAfter arriving to the gymnasium, students were exposed to many informal events.  They had the opportunity to either eat a meal of barbecue, or participate in activities and games.  The rock climbing wall, with the longest line of people, seemed to be the most popular activity.  Other students curiously stared at people playing a game called gaga.  Gina Warren, director of Campus Recreation, explained that the objective of gaga was to stay inside the circle of boards and not get hit by the red ball.  Although students were unfamiliar with the game, most seemed to enjoy it when they played.\r\n\r\nThe formal events were kicked off when Warren welcomed everyone to the event.  Following the welcome, the male and female pep leaders entertained the crowd with their portrayal of cheerleaders.  Both groups assembled in a line and acted like dominoes to a motion or move made at the ends of the lines.  Fran Spears, UTM cheerleading coach, later introduced her squad of cheerleaders who livened up the crowd with flips and lifts. \r\n\r\nCompetitions for the night were started by choosing the most spirited group in the crowd.  This award went to Group 19, Secondary Education. \r\n\r\nThe recreational staff then drew group numbers from a box to invite a chosen number of members from each group down to the floor to compete in several events.  Annie Naik, of Paris, says that the hula hoop relay was her favorite activity.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I enjoyed the hula hoop activity the best, because most of my group was able to participate.  Our group almost won the first time around.Ã¢â‚¬?\r\n\r\nThe most anticipated competition of the night was the judging of the banners.  Banners were made by each group earlier this week.  Most banners were in some representation of their group''s major.  Banners with slogans such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Vets Hauling Your Pets,Ã¢â‚¬? were made by the Pre-Vet majors.  The business management group displayed, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Manage Your Money, or be Somebody''s Honey.Ã¢â‚¬?  The winning banner was made by Group 48, major undeclared.  \r\n\r\nGroup 48, led by pep leaders Carrie and Laura, made their banner into a bust shot of a confused person wearing a T-shirt entitled, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Got Major?  We don''t.Ã¢â‚¬?  \r\n\r\nGroup 48, was awarded a pizza party sometime during this semester.  Second place for the banners was awarded to Groups 42 and 43.  Their banner was a picture of a nurse eagerly holding a needle saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby, your butt is mine.Ã¢â‚¬?\r\n\r\nDrawings were made throughout the night for prizes as well.  \r\n\r\nFor one to have their name eligible for the drawing, they must have participated in one of the activities.  \r\n\r\nPrizes included free meals from McDonalds, movie passes from the Cine, accessories from the computer store and T-shirts from the UTM bookstore.  Grand winners of the drawing were Jonathan Medina, who won a $50 gift certificate to the Ken-Tenn sports store, and Brad Walters who won a Schwinn mountain bike at a valued price of $250.  Walters'' thoughts on his win were, Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is awesome!Ã¢â‚¬?\r\n\r\nMost realized the fun and excitement those two hours at Recreational Rampage had to offer.  But to the staff at campus recreation, the fun and excitement began two weeks earlier. \r\n\r\nWarren says that she and her staff started their work a few weeks earlier by soliciting prizes from the businesses. \r\n\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It is the donated prizes that make this night so much fun,Ã¢â‚¬?says Warren.  The pep leaders also put a lot of time into making the events happen.  They have spent several hours with their group working on banners, logos and chants.  Leader of Group 47, Candace Tate, says that Recreational Rampage is worth the planning.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think it''s great fun.  There are many opportunities for freshmen to see what happens throughout the year.  It is an experience for all involved.Ã¢â‚¬?', 1, 'Campus', '2002-08-16 00:00:00', '2005-12-10 00:00:00', 755);

Classes begin Aug. 19, and the campus is buzzing, preparing to welcome more than 1,000 new faces to campus within the next few weeks. Meanwhile, new students are counting down their last few days of summer, saying goodbye to old friends and packing their belongings in anticipation of college life.\r\n\r\nFor all the excitement, the transition to college life can be rough on new students. Below, Denny Bubrig, coordinator of student activities and Greek life in the UTM office of student affairs, offers his Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ËœTop 15 Tips for Going Away to CollegeÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to help smooth the way:\r\n\r\n15. Beware the Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Freshman 15Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬?! This comes from the 10-15 casual pounds that a freshman puts on in their first year. Pizza is not a part of the four food groups!\r\n\r\n14. Find your community''s equivalent to Wal-Mart! It becomes the number one social outlet for new students and their parents on Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“move-in day.Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬?\r\n\r\n13. Go to class! If you don''t plan on getting up at 8 a.m., don''t take an 8 a.m. class. Attendance in class can make or break your grade for the semester. If you are absent, whether written down or not, it will be noticed.\r\n\r\n12. Plan ahead. Make contact with your roommate so that you don''t duplicate bringing things for your room. It also helps to find your classes before the first day if you aren''t familiar with campus.\r\n\r\n11. No one is here to take care of you! For a lot of new students, things like laundry and cooking are unfamiliar territory! Get your parents to give you some tips in advance.\r\n\r\n10. Faculty are friends, but college is not an extension of high school. You will not be reminded on a daily basis of what you have due or when a critical assignment is made. Planners are extremely helpful, and use the syllabi that are given out, too. Talk to your professors! They don''t bite! They want you to be successful for four years and not just one semester.\r\n\r\n9. College is not a movie, but all work and no play makes college boring! There are a lot of things to do and a lot of people for you to meet, but academics is what will keep you here in the long run. Balance your playing with what you have to get done academically.\r\n\r\n8. If you get in a pinch, use the college to help you! Most colleges have things like tutoring programs, counseling centers, or other avenues to assist you if you get in a bind.\r\n\r\n7. Yes, you will get homesick. Stock up on phone cards and be prepared for some emotional conversations. Parents, mail is a lot nicer than an empty box, even if it is just to say hello. Temptation will make you want to run home, but the more you leave campus, the more you could be missing out on.\r\n\r\n6. Credit cards and cash are real money! Be careful with your spending!\r\n\r\n5. Flip-flops come in handy ...\r\n\r\n4. Be open-minded. College will throw issues and situations your way that you might not have ever dealt with before. Be prepared to look at things from every possible angle.\r\n\r\n3. Driving to class is not a luxury! Most campuses'' parking areas are designated for different types of permits. If you park in one of those and you should not be there, you will rack up tickets. If you live on campus, walk or ride a bike to class!\r\n\r\n2. Patience is a virtue. Don''t rush through your college experience, but don''t drag it out either. The four or five years you spend in college are what prepare you for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\n1. The number one tip is ... Get involved! If you go to class, return to your room or apartment, and don''t participate in activities, you will be missing out on a lot the college has to offer. Find the groups and events that interest you and be a part!\r\n\r\nBubrig is leading UTM first coordinated move-in program for new students.Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“Move-In DaysÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬? is designed to help students with the move-in process, whether they require muscle power for carrying boxes, directions to locations around campus, or simply a cool cup of lemonade.

LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not forget the many positive attributes of this campus and the people who work and study here.\r\n\r\nWe must enhance our state funding, raise more private dollars, and enter into more partnerships while making sure we allocate our limited resources to their proper places. \r\n\r\nThis means we must be creative in the way we finance higher education.  We must think outside the box and look to ways other than state appropriations and increases in student tuition.  An important part of stable funding is stable enrollment and that is the business of everyone on campus.  Currently enrolled students are an important component of our marketing efforts.  I hope we can involve more students and faculty in our legislative actions.  The student voter registration effort this fall is also important.\r\n\r\nWe must lift UT Martin to the next level of excellence. \r\n\r\nThis involves many things.  The new admission standards; completing our plan for new student housing; web site improvements; a critical review of the curriculum and program offerings; working on the Campus that Cares image; hiring and retaining good faculty and staff; being more proactive in recruiting African-American staff and faculty; and empowering faculty and staff to make the necessary changes to improve their particular office or department.

Two of her goals were game-winners for the Skyhawks. \r\n\r\nAlso from Germantown is Amy King, a sophomore forward who took seven shots and led the team in assists. \r\n\r\nOther returning players who made an impact include Rachel Callahan, a sophomore midfielder from Versailles, Ky. and Ginger Parson, a midfielder from The Colony, Texas. \r\nSenior Sherrie Weeks, a left midfielder from Vernon, British Columbia, is the team&#8217;s leader on the field, along with seniors Tavi Renier and goalkeeper Caryn Scheufler. Weeks was tabbed All-Ohio Valley Conference Honorable Mention and a team MVP for the Skyhawks for her efforts last year. With her 35 shots and seven goals last season, Weeks holds both the career lead in shots and goals for UTM. \r\n\r\nScheufler is entering her second year at UT Martin after transferring from Young Harris College. The senior goalkeeper, from Carrolton, Ga., was named to the All-OVC team after picking up 144 saves for UT Martin, putting her second on the all-time saves list. \r\n\r\nRenier, a midfielder from Tuscon, Ariz, had one goal and one assist for UT Martin in 2001. \r\n\r\nWith no juniors on the team, the three seniors must rely on the sophomores and freshmen. \r\n\r\nRounding out the returners are Emily Cairncross (D, London, Ontario); Joanna Gomez (D/MF, Clarksville); Meghann Jordan (D, Hendersonville); and Emily Miller (F, Collierville). \r\n\r\nOklahoma proved to be a hot bed for the Skyhawks as four of the 11 newcomers, Sarah Barnes, Danelle Myrick, Lindsey Tilk and Kitty Trent, make their way on to the team. Myrick and Trent have experience playing for the Oklahoma Olympic Development Program (ODP) state team. Trent and Tilk also played club soccer as members of the Oklahoma Shockers. \r\n\r\nAlissa Ruud, a defender and all-conference selection comes to UT Martin from Moline, Ill. She also has club experience playing for the Quad City Strikers. \r\n\r\nA late addition to the Skyhawk roster is Shannon Lewis who comes to UT Martin from Santa Cruz, Bolivia and is hoping to see some time in the goal. \r\n\r\nFilling out the rest of the roster, five newcomers call the Volunteer state their home. Coming from Columbia are Lauren Cook adn Megan Dempsey. Cook splits time in the midfield and forward positions while Dempsey prefers the goal. Cook was named all-district and all-region while playing for Columbia Academy, while Dempsey was a three-time all-district selection at Columbia Central. \r\n\r\nTabitha Fishburn will be looking for a spot with the Skyhawk midfield after being a four year starter at Gallatin High School. She earned all-district and all-tournament awards while with the Green Wave and also played for the Gallatin Soccer Club. \r\nKatie Hausauer comes to UT Martin from Clarksville. She started for four years at defense, being named to the all-district team the past three. She also garnered a lot of experience while playing for the Lady Royals Soccer Club. \r\n\r\nRounding out the team is Katie Jackson, a forward from Franklin where she helped lead her team to a state championship in 2000 and state runner up title in 2001.

He compiled a .262 batting average, 2,460 hits, 580 stolen bases and 13 Gold Glove awards. He set major league records for his position with most assists (8,375); most double plays (1,590), most total chances accepted (12,624), most years with 500 or more assists (8) and most years leading the league in assists and chances accepted. \r\n\r\nFor Smith''s accomplishments he was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. His July 28 induction ceremony is a prestigious honor reserved only for the most accomplished individuals in baseball''s history. \r\n\r\nBeth Elliott''s softball accomplishments at UTM are decent, but they''re a far cry from Smith''s stats. Elliott started 28-of-49 games this past season as an outfielder and hit .231. She was among the team''s best defensive players with a .968 fielding percentage. \r\n\r\nYet, Elliott who graduated from UTM Aug. 4, spent her entire summer in the Baseball Hall of Fame - as a student intern in retail services. \r\n\r\nElliott was one of more than 30 students from across the United States to participate in the Frank and Peggy Steele Internship Program for Youth Leadership Development at the Baseball Hall of Fame. Steele interns receive meaningful, hands-on training in numerous professional areas, including research, exhibit design, membership, education, archives and collections management, accounting, retail, visitor services, programming and public relations. \r\n\r\nFor Elliott, the internship completed the requirements for her degree in health and human performance. \r\n\r\n"It''s been a great summer so far," Elliott said. "I was looking forward to induction weekend, and it was everything they said it would be and more." \r\n\r\nThe night before Smith''s induction, a special reception was held in his honor at the Hall of Fame. The rules were set, and everyone in retail services was told no autographs and no photos. For Elliott, the reception was like a dream where Hall of Famers came to life. She waited on Yogi Berra, Willie Mays, \r\nCarlton Fisk, Don Sutton, Dave Winfield and Reggie Jackson. \r\n\r\nSpeaking and interacting with the baseball greats was just the beginning for Elliott. The next day at the induction, Stan Musial played "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" on his harmonica, and Smith''s induction speech brought tears to many, including Elliott. \r\n\r\n"He teared me up pretty good," she said. \r\n\r\nElliott''s passion for the game began when she was just a little girl growing up in Dover, Tenn. "When I was growing up we were always trying to get a game up, whether it was baseball or basketball. We would always play something when relatives came to visit," she said. \r\n\r\nElliott''s athletic career began in the fourth grade with basketball and expanded to softball during her high school days. "I have always been a Braves fan, but Ozzie Smith and the Cardinals were some of the first players I remember watching on television." \r\n\r\nAlthough Elliott admits she is still a Braves fan, she treks to St. Louis several times a year to watch the Cardinals. \r\nDonley Canary, Elliott''s softball coach this past season at UTM, said he never met anyone as passionate about baseball as Elliott. "Early in the season we played in Atlanta, and we had some free time. Beth was the first one to get everyone organized and ready to go to the Braves game. She didn''t want to miss a single pitch," Canary said. \r\n\r\n"Beth is a super kid," Canary continued. "She works hard at everything she does, and she''s extremely smart." \r\n\r\nShe''s so smart, she''s made the Dean''s list five consecutive semesters at UTM. Elliott''s ability to utilize her resources and her passion for baseball led her to the Internet and the internship at the Hall of Fame. \r\n\r\n"I knew I had to do an internship, so I started looking for opportunities in baseball," Elliott said. "I looked at a lot of Major League teams and a bunch of Minor League teams, and the Baseball Hall of Fame." Once she learned about the opportunity at the Hall of Fame, she applied and completed the required phone interview. Soon she was driving the 20 hours north to Cooperstown, N.Y. \r\n\r\nElliott''s first trip to the Hall of Fame was the day she reported to work, May 21. Her home away-from-home for the summer was Hardwick College, about 30 minutes from Cooperstown. Most of the interns stayed at Hardwick and made the daily drive to the Hall of Fame. \r\n\r\n"My parents were extremely excited about my internship, but they didn''t want me to make Cooperstown my home," Elliott said. \r\n\r\nBut after spending the summer in the home of legends, Elliott is going to be hard pressed to abandon her love of the game - after all, she can claim she was a Hall of Famer.

This event will take place on Sept. 11th  at noon on the plaza north of the University Center.  If dismal weather occurs, the event will take place in the Watkins Auditorium.\r\n\r\n High says the purpose of this event is two fold.

Candy Goad with student affairs says that the police, sheriff, fire, and EMS of Weakly and surrounding counties have been invited.  \r\n\r\nAfter HighÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s explanation of Unite Our Schools, she asked that SGA be involved.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“It will become an annual event for the school.Ã¢â‚¬?\r\n\r\nSGAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s answer to a call of involvement was by means of providing a canvas scroll at the program.  The scroll would be used for students to sign their names and write messages of patriotism.  \r\n\r\nMuch debate occurred over what to do with the scroll after the program.  Original suggestions were to send the scroll to the mayor of New York.  Senators then began discussing the fact that New York will probably be inundated with scrolls and messages.  Jennifer Ogg made the statement that if the scroll could not be sent to New York, pictures of the scroll could be sent.  The Senate passed a motion to have President Tolbert write a letter to New York.\r\n\r\nThe Senate agreed that there would be more benefit by leaving the scroll here on campus.  A motion was made to place the scroll in the University Center.  This motion was passed without any opponents.  Brian Davis, Campus Observation Chair, made a motion that a decision on the exact placement of the scroll be tabled until next meeting.

High informed the body that the program is to be 30-45 minutes long, beginning at noon.  The question was asked by the Senate if students would be excused from class.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The recommendation is being made for teachers to allow dismissal of classes.  I would hate to see a professor say that their students have to be at a lecture.  However, the professors will be the ones making the final decision.  It is their choiceÃ¢â‚¬?, says High.\r\n\r\nHigh has asked President Bush and congressmen to send her letters about the attack  While the program itself is still in the developing stages, participation may be seen from student choir members and ROTC color guard.  Tolbert asks that students show their patriotism by wearing red, white, and blue.    \r\n\r\nAnother issue discussed during the meeting was voter registration.  Tolbert stated that during the previous voter registration drive, 177 freshmen signed up to vote.  Governmental Affairs Chair John Lankford stated that the next drive is going to be Sept. 17-24th.  While the registration numbers are looking good, Lankford says the easy part is over.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“The hard part is actually getting the students to go to the poles and vote,Ã¢â‚¬? says Lankford. \r\n\r\nCommittees will meet in the future to discuss evolving issues such as public housing.  High states that all they need is a green light from the state.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“As soon as we get a go ahead, we will start posting a series of focus groups from students.  We need to hear from students.  We need to know what they want and what they are willing to pay for.  We want the premier housing of Tennessee.Ã¢â‚¬?\r\n\r\nTolbert briefly outlined projects for the year.  He said that Homecoming would be at its best this year, with speakers, comedians, movies, and intramurals.  He also urges students to check their UTM email for announcements regarding events.\r\nOther announcements were made.

Graham Stadium.  \r\n\r\nAfter losing the lead with only a little over five minutes left on the clock the Skyhawks rallied. After receiving the ball at the Skyhawk 47-yard line, Sam Berrien rushed for three yards to the UTM 44-yard line.  \r\n\r\nOn the next snap, Kendric Edwards rushed five yards to the UTM 49-yard line for a first down for the Skyhawks and then continued to rush seven yards on the next play.  Carl Lattimore gained six yards for a Skyhawk first down.  \r\n\r\nAfter Williams rushed nine yards to the Southwest Baptist 29, Edwards rushed to complete a first down.  At the 27-yard line, Williams rushed for no gain, but the next play to Lattimore gained the Skyhawks three yards.  \r\n\r\nAfter a pass for 15 yards to Duane Corlett, Williams completed a pass to Russell Gambrell for 20 yards to the 7-yard line.  After a one yard gain by Lattimore, Williams pass attempt to John McAdams failed. \r\n\r\nHowever, the Skyhawks found the end zone on the next play as Lattimore rushed for six yards to the Southwest Baptist goal line to score the touchdown with only 27 seconds left in the game. \r\n\r\nSouthwest Baptist tried to make a comeback. The Bearcats were able to complete two nine-yard passes, both of them from Mark Schuck to Marc Green, but were unable to complete the rally.\r\n\r\nBoth the Skyhawks and Bearcats battled back and forth through the opening minutes of the first half. The Skyhawk defense turned the tide of the first quarter when cornerback Ralph Hines intercepted an errant Bearcat pass and returned it 10 yards to the SBU 37 before being run out of bounds. \r\n\r\nFollowing a Damien Harris one-yard run, Williams hit McAdams with a 12-yard bullet across the middle to give the Skyhawks a first down at the Bearcat 24. Andrew Staten gained another five yards, but the ''Cat defense halted the UTM drive stopping Berrien twice for no gain. Facing a fourth-and-five, Coach McCorkle called on place-kicker Brent Harris, who nailed a 36-yard field goal with 43 seconds remaining in the first quarter to give the Skyhawks an early 3-0 lead.\r\n\r\nOn the ensuing Bearcat drive, the UTM defense made another big play, as the Skyhawks forced Nathan Dunn to fumble at the SBU 29. \r\n\r\nThe fumble was recovered by linebacker Thomas Harris.\r\nBeginning the second stanza at the Bearcat 28, Marcus Ross quickly put the Skyhawks within striking distance of the goal line, as his 23-yard carry took UTM to the SBU five.  \r\n\r\nStaten picked up two yards on the next play, then two plays later, Williams scored the first touchdown of the Skyhawk''s season with 13:11 remaining in the first half. Harris added the extra point to stretch the UTM lead to 10-0. \r\n\r\nSBU retaliated on their next possession. After the Bearcats recovered on-side kick at the UTM 43, Dunn began the drive of a 16-yard run to the Skyhawk 27. Dunn came up big again, as he grabbed a 19-yard pass and took it to the UTM eight. \r\n\r\nDunn continued his effort with a five-yard pick-up before being stopped for no gain on the next play at the three. \r\n\r\nThe Bearcats cut the UTM lead to four on the next play as Lowe hit Green for a three-yard touchdown pass with 10:35 left in the half to make the score 10-6. \r\n\r\nThe Bearcat momentum continued on the next Skyhawk drive as SBU forced Lattimore to fumble on the first play of the \r\nSkyhawk''s next drive and recover the ball on the UTM 18.\r\n\r\nThree Marco Kirven carries took the Bearcats to within two yards of the goal line. The UTM defense toughened up keeping SBU out of the end zone for two plays before a Green touchdown run with 6:38 remaining in the half, giving the Bearcats a 12-10 lead.\r\n\r\nBoth teams held each other off of the board through the third quarter, but the Skyhawks struck early in the final frame.  Beginning at their own 42-yard line, the Skyhawks put together a 16-play, 71-yard drive that was capped off by a 26-yard Harris field goal with 9:12 left in the game to give UTM a 13-12 lead.\r\n\r\nHowever, that lead only lasted 7:35, as the Bearcats rode Kirven again as the SBU running back gained 14 yards on three plays. \r\n\r\nThe last run, a three-yard gain, took the Bearcats to the UTM 33. \r\nA face mask penalty on the same play added five yards to the gain, placing the ball on the 28-yard line. \r\n\r\nA penalty on the next play pushed the Bearcats back to the UTM 38, but, on the next play, Lowe hit Kevin Whitley for a 38-yard touchdown pass with 5:29 left, returning the lead to the Bearcats at 18-13.\r\n\r\nA 15-yard kick-off return by Kidane McBride set up UTM''s final scoring drive.\r\n\r\nDunn paced all rushers with 80 yards on 11 carries. Ross and Berrien lead UTM in rushing with 65 yards apiece. \r\n\r\nLowe completed 12 of 23 passes for 121 yards and two touchdowns for the Bearcats in the loss.\r\n\r\nThe Skyhawks will hope to continue their winning ways at 6 p.m. next Thursday as the Pioneers from Tusculum College come to Martin.

We had  been together only a short time, but we were really happy. \r\nWe had made the pact to break up before school so we wouldn&#8217;t be tied down (he went 2 hours away to another school). \r\n\r\nNow I can&#8217;t think of anything but him. I have been walking around in a funk and my friends are refusing to talk to me until I break free. What can I do to get rid of this feeling?\r\n\r\nAll Funked Out\r\n\r\nDear All Funked Out,\r\nIt&#8217;s hard having to adjust to something new on its own, such as your first year of college. \r\n\r\nIt&#8217;s even more difficult to begin it after breaking up with someone you care about.\r\n\r\nFirst off, your friends. If they were really your friends, they&#8217;d help you out with your problem. \r\n\r\nAbandoning you in your moment of need isn&#8217;t something that friends do. \r\n\r\nFriends help through the good times and the bad &#8211; and you definitely qualify in the bad category. They should be the ones that are keeping you company and lessening your loneliness. \r\n\r\nMaybe you should examine your friendships and see if they even have your interests at heart. \r\n\r\nBut if they have good reason to be like this, (e.g. you talk about him nonstop, you refuse to go out of your room without his picture on you, and you can&#8217;t reach your mouth with your fork cause you are too distressed), then maybe they have a legitimate concern.\r\n\r\nAs for your healing process &#8211; everyone heals in their own way and on their own time. \r\n\r\nI was always told that the healing process is half the time the relationship lasted. \r\n\r\nIt does vary depending on strength of feelings and how much you will see the person. You will feel hurt and rejected for a bit. \r\n\r\nYou may cry yourself to sleep. You may go on rants in sociology class that speak of the evil boys that run around unsupervised and demand they be chained in a dungeon. \r\n\r\nPeople deal with it in different ways. Just make sure that it doesn&#8217;t consume your life. \r\n\r\nIf you find you would rather sit in you room in your pajamas, playing &#8220;Goodbye to You&#8221; by Michelle Branch while gripping a teddy bear and crying your eyes out instead of heading off to bio lab, then maybe you should head over to the counseling center. \r\n\r\nIt&#8217;s ok to grieve for the break-up, but when it affects the academic aspect of your life, then you need to look into getting some help. Good luck.\r\n\r\nDear Advice Girl,\r\n\r\nMyself, my girlfriend, and my suitemate were sitting around \r\ntalking, and my suitemate was at the computer.  \r\n\r\nHe brought up my browser history, and he and my girlfriend saw all of the porn sites I had visited.  \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend told me I was nasty, and that I think more of porn than I think of her.  \r\n\r\nWhat should I do?\r\n\r\nRight Hand Man\r\n\r\nDear Right Hand Man,\r\n\r\nTell your girlfriend that she should stop worrying about it. There must be some reason for her to feel this way. \r\n\r\nHave you told her how much you cared about her lately? Maybe you have been neglecting her and she is using your porn to establish that there is a problem.\r\n\r\nExplain that there is a difference between looking and doing. \r\n\r\nYou are obviously still with her, so she has nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\nWomen are very high strung creatures who need to be reassured constantly. \r\n\r\nMake sure you tell her how much you care for her and how much you love her no matter what.

Even though the state projects a two percent increase in revenue, they raised tuition seven and a half percent. \r\n\r\nPlus itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to cost more for a sticker to park.

Alexander said that he did not support bills that created special benefits to groups of citizens.

LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face it people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the South doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to be the most open-minded area of the states. And if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always lived in the South, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure you can think of a few idiotic slurs that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard concerning interracial dating.\r\n\r\nNumber two Ã¢â‚¬â€œ being in the South, we have a number of communities who have received a reputation for their racist activities and beliefs. Anyone ever heard of Skullbone? I realize it may not be in the Weakley County area, but ask any of us Gibson County residents about its reputation.  \r\n\r\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not saying that their reputation is necessarily factual.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps it is just a good example about the problems we have with this subject. Interracial dating first came to mind after passing by an extremely tense and ignorant situation in the quad. An African-American student and his Caucasian girlfriend were walking through the quad enjoying their day, while behind them two people snickered and joked about what they called, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the oddly coupleÃ¢â‚¬?. The couple had the decency and the common sense to look past the ignorance and walk away. My challenge to all of you is to look past any ignorance you have experienced or have thought about experiencing as far as racism goes. We are all in this together and surely there are more important issues to address than ones that have been going on for years.  \r\n\r\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s get some new issues and better ideas. (After all, we have plenty of room in opinionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.hint hint).\r\n\r\nSo, my question to all of you is Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is it really appropriate to criticize someone who is in an interracial relationship at this time in our lives? \r\n\r\n<i> Rebecca Paschall is a junior communications major from Rutherford, Tennessee.</i> ', 7, 'Letters', '2002-08-30 00:00:00', '2005-12-10 00:00:00', 388);

"Our staff is wonderful and we are like family."\r\n\r\nSeveral companies bid on the management of the UTM bookstore, and Barnes and Noble was selected.

Covington further explains, "Barnes and Noble will set prices on the books at the bookstore with UTM acquiring a percentage of the profits." \r\n\r\nUTM will continue to recycle used books in their buy-back policy in a continued effort to benefit the students financially.  \r\nAssistant Manager Louise Gardner is still employed by UTM and offers her 21 years of experience to assist in the transition to Barnes and Noble.  \r\n\r\n"Book prices increase every year," says Gardner.\r\n\r\nTeresa Vancleave, bookkeeper for the UTM bookstore for 14 years and teacher for PACT courses for the past two years states, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Changes take time, but we are adapting.Ã¢â‚¬?\r\n\r\nThe bookstore still operates with the help of students and volunteers on a regular work schedule.
