Using a tool such as phpMyAdmin, create a database for your tables to reside within.   2. You will need to know the hostname, database name, username and password for your database installation.   3. Assign read and write permissions to the user that will be accessing the database.          * Note: We recommend creating a separate user account that only has permissions on this one database for security reasons. === PHP Scripts ===   1. Upload the entire contents of the package to your server root, typically an htdocs, www or public folder.   2. If you have access to the command line, change the file permissions for the cache directory.          * chmod 777 cache/    3. You will also need write permissions on the ./includes folder if you wish to use the config file writer.          * chmod 777 includes/ === Web Based Installation ===   1. Open your Web browser to http://path_to_pacercms/INSTALL/, with the CAPTIAL letters.   2. If you have already made the ./includes folder writable, you should be prompted to create the config file.   3. Complete the steps provided to create the config.php file that will reside in ./includes folder.   4. Upon successful completion, you will be directed to the installer.   5. Complete the steps provided to create the database structure and load the default data.   6. Be sure to write down the random password given to you, and change it to one that is easy to remember but hard to guess. === Alternative Installation ===   1. Copy the ./includes/config-sample.php file to ./includes/config.php .   2. Modify the config.php file to reflect your server settings.   3. Using phpMyAdmin or other such utility, load the database dump in the ./INSTALL/demo/ folder.   4. You will need to update these tables with the proper name and url for your site: cm_settings, cm_sections.   5. By default, your username will be 'admin' and your password will also be 'admin'. === Site Settings ===   1. Login to the Site Administration section by opening http://path_to_pacercms/siteadmin/ in your browser.   2. Use the login creditials created during the installation process.   3. Review the Settings module to add contact information for your publication.   4. Review the Sections module to make the sections reflect the section name and editors used by your publication.   5. Open the Users module to change the password or add contact information for the site administrator.   6. Use the Users module to create login accounts for each contributor the site, using the Access sub-module to control how they interact with the Web site. === Template Design ===PacerCMS uses a blue template as the default theme. If you have copied the contents of the ./templates/default folder to ./templates/local and made the necessary adjustments in the ./includes/config.php file, you can begin editing the files to match your own desired templates.Please see our Template Guides at http://code.google.com/p/pacercms/w/list for more information.
